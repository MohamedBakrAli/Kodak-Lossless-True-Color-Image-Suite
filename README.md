#  Kodak Lossless True Color Image Suite

The pictures below link to lossless, true color (24 bits per pixel, aka "full color") images.  It is my understanding they have been released by the Eastman Kodak Company for unrestricted usage.  Many sites use them as a standard test suite for compression testing, etc.
Prior to this site, they were only available in the Sun Raster format via ftp.  This meant that the images could not be previewed before downloading.  Since their release, however, the lossless PNG format has been incorporated into all the major browsers.  Since PNG supports 24-bit lossless color (which GIF and JPEG do not), it is now possible to offer this browser-friendly access to the images.
